| Pricing | Original price $0.10 / request, discounted price $0.05 / request |

### Request Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `input` | `string` | Yes | The text content to convert to speech |
| `voice` | `string` | Yes | Voice type, e.g.: `heart` |
| `response_format` | `string` | No | Output audio format, e.g.: `mp3`, `wav`, `ogg` |

### Response

The endpoint directly returns **binary audio file content**, with response header `Content-Type: application/octet-stream`. There is no JSON wrapper — the response body is the audio file itself.

## Generation-time Usage (Agent Direct Call)

After calling the API, binary audio data is returned directly and must be saved to a local file.

> For complete TypeScript code and the download workflow, see the "Generation-time Usage" section in `references/speech-api.md`.

---

## Post-generation Usage (In-app via Edge Function)

In an application, requests are proxied through an Edge Function. The Edge Function stores the binary audio stream to Supabase Storage and returns a persistent public URL to the frontend.
