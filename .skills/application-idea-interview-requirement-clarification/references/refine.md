# Phase 2: Refine (Concept Refinement)

## Overview

Refines raw ideas into sharp, actionable concepts worth building through structured divergent and convergent thinking.

## When to Use

- User has a clear intent but the idea is vague
- User says: "ideate", "refine this idea", "stress-test my plan"
- Need to expand options before converging on one

**When NOT to use:**

- The ask is already clear and well-specified
- User just needs implementation (skip to design phase)
- Pure information requests

## How It Works

1. **Understand & Expand (Divergent):** Restate the idea, ask sharpening questions, and generate variations.
2. **Evaluate & Converge:** Cluster ideas, stress-test them, and surface hidden assumptions.
3. **Sharpen & Ship:** Produce a concrete markdown one-pager moving work forward.

## Process

### Phase 1: Understand & Expand (Divergent)

**Goal:** Take the raw idea and open it up.

1. **Restate the idea** as a crisp "How Might We" problem statement. This forces clarity on what's actually being solved.

2. **Ask 3-5 sharpening questions** — no more. Focus on:
   - Who is this for, specifically?
   - What does success look like?
   - What are the real constraints (time, tech, resources)?
   - What's been tried before?
   - Why now?

3. **Generate 5-8 idea variations** using these lenses:
   - **Inversion:** "What if we did the opposite?"
   - **Constraint removal:** "What if budget/time/tech weren't factors?"
   - **Audience shift:** "What if this were for [different user]?"
   - **Combination:** "What if we merged this with [adjacent idea]?"
   - **Simplification:** "What's the version that's 10x simpler?"
   - **10x version:** "What would this look like at massive scale?"
   - **Expert lens:** "What would [domain] experts find obvious that outsiders wouldn't?"

Push beyond what the user initially asked for. Create products people don't know they need yet.

**If running inside a codebase:** Use context from existing architecture, patterns, constraints. Ground your variations in what actually exists.

### Phase 2: Evaluate & Converge

After the user reacts to Phase 1 (indicates which ideas resonate, pushes back, adds context), shift to convergent mode:

1. **Cluster** the ideas that resonated into 2-3 distinct directions. Each direction should feel meaningfully different.

2. **Stress-test** each direction against three criteria:
   - **User value:** Who benefits and how much? Is this a painkiller or a vitamin?
   - **Feasibility:** What's the technical and resource cost? What's the hardest part?
   - **Differentiation:** What makes this genuinely different? Would someone switch from their current solution?

3. **Surface hidden assumptions.** For each direction, explicitly name:
   - What you're betting is true (but haven't validated)
   - What could kill this idea
   - What you're choosing to ignore (and why that's okay for now)

This is where most ideation fails. Don't skip it.

**Be honest, not supportive.** If an idea is weak, say so with kindness. A good ideation partner is not a yes-machine.

### Phase 3: Sharpen & Ship

Produce a concrete artifact — a markdown one-pager that moves work forward:

```markdown
# [Idea Name]

## Problem Statement
[One-sentence "How Might We" framing]

## Recommended Direction
[The chosen direction and why — 2-3 paragraphs max]

## Key Assumptions to Validate
- [ ] [Assumption 1 — how to test it]
- [ ] [Assumption 2 — how to test it]
- [ ] [Assumption 3 — how to test it]

## MVP Scope
[The minimum version that tests the core assumption. What's in, what's out.]

## Not Doing (and Why)
- [Thing 1] — [reason]
- [Thing 2] — [reason]
- [Thing 3] — [reason]

## Open Questions
- [Question that needs answering before building]
```

**The "Not Doing" list is arguably the most valuable part.** Focus is about saying no to good ideas. Make the trade-offs explicit.

Ask the user if they'd like to save this to `docs/ideas/[idea-name].md`. Only save if they confirm.

## Philosophy

- Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Push toward the simplest version that still solves the real problem.
- Start with the user experience, work backwards to technology.
- Say no to 1,000 things. Focus beats breadth.
- Challenge every assumption. "How it's usually done" is not a reason.
- Show people the future — don't just give them better horses.
- The parts you can't see should be as beautiful as the parts you can.

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

- **Don't generate 20+ ideas.** Quality over quantity. 5-8 well-considered variations beat 20 shallow ones.
- **Don't be a yes-machine.** Push back on weak ideas with specificity and kindness.
- **Don't skip "who is this for."** Every good idea starts with a person and their problem.
- **Don't produce a plan without surfacing assumptions.** Untested assumptions are the #1 killer of good ideas.
- **Don't over-engineer the process.** Three phases, each doing one thing well.
- **Don't just list ideas — tell a story.** Each variation should have a reason it exists.
- **Don't ignore the codebase.** If you're in a project, the existing architecture is a constraint and an opportunity.

## Tone

Direct, thoughtful, slightly provocative. You're a sharp thinking partner, not a facilitator reading from a script. Channel the energy of "that's interesting, but what if..." — always pushing one step further without being exhausting.

## Red Flags

- Generating 20+ shallow variations instead of 5-8 considered ones
- Skipping the "who is this for" question
- No assumptions surfaced before committing to a direction
- Yes-machining weak ideas instead of pushing back with specificity
- Producing a plan without a "Not Doing" list
- Ignoring existing codebase constraints when ideating inside a project
- Jumping straight to Phase 3 output without running Phases 1 and 2

## Verification

After completing an ideation session:

- [ ] A clear "How Might We" problem statement exists
- [ ] The target user and success criteria are defined
- [ ] Multiple directions were explored, not just the first idea
- [ ] Hidden assumptions are explicitly listed with validation strategies
- [ ] A "Not Doing" list makes trade-offs explicit
- [ ] The output is a concrete artifact (markdown one-pager), not just conversation
- [ ] The user confirmed the final direction before any implementation work
