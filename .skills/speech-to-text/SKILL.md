## Generation-time Usage (Agent Direct Call)

The platform injects the API key — no user-supplied key is needed.

> For complete TypeScript code (URL submission and local file upload), see the "Generation-time Usage" section in `references/transcriptions-api.md`.

---

## Post-generation Usage (In-app via Edge Function)

When called from within an application, requests must be proxied through an Edge Function to keep the platform key out of the frontend.

> For the complete Edge Function code and frontend call patterns, see the "Post-generation Usage" section in `references/transcriptions-api.md`.
